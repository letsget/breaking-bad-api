## Fetching characters with Breaking Bad API

Dedicated to all Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul fans. 
Looking forward to Better Call Saul Final season.

I got the idea for this lesson from Traversy Media - a popular YouTuber who has excellent coding tutoruals on his channel.
His implementation used Reac-hooks and functional components, I did the same, only decided to go with Redux for state management.
